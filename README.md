English abstract:

Wilmact is a sample actuator-software for an ESP8266, which is presented as a compatible smart-home switch in the fritzbox webinterface and can be used similar to DECT 200/210 or powerline 546E. The builtin LED of the ESP8266 microcontroller can be toggled like other fritz actuators.
Although wilmact is written for an ESP8266, wilmact-source also runs completely without the microcontroller hardware in an ESP8266 simulation under linux.
